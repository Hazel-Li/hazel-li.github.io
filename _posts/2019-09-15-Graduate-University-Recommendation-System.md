# Context

This is a Data Mining project based on a forum called <a href="https://www.thegradcafe.com/">Gradcafe</a>.

Prospective graduate students have long been wondering what factors are taken into consideration by the admission office and whether their academic achievements are sufficient for a particular program. Using a dataset with over 30,000 entries from TheGradCafe.com, this project aimed to provide insight on the admission requirements of each school and major, generate a recommendation list using Collaborative Filtering, and predict the admission rates for each school to assist students in their decision-making process.
